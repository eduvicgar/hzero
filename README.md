# hzero (EN)

[Leer en español](docs/README.es.md)

**hzero** is a statistical inference library focused on the implementation of hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric. It is designed as an educational and experimental tool to explore the behavior of different statistical tests under various conditions.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently under active development. It is not yet available as an installable package.

## ✨ Main Features

- Implementation of distributions used in hypothesis testing (such as Student's t, chi-square, etc.)  
- Support for parametric hypothesis tests  
- Visualization of results with **matplotlib**  
- Extensive use of **NumPy** for efficient numerical operations  

## 📦 Technologies Used

- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  

## 🔧 Installation

> [!NOTE]  
> For now, there is no standard way to install hzero. To use it, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduvicgar/hzero.git  
cd hzero
```

Then you can import the modules directly from your local development environment.

## 📌 Upcoming Improvements

- More parametric hypothesis tests (variance, difference of means, and ratio of variances)  
- Non-parametric hypothesis tests such as Pearson’s chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov  
- More automated tests  
- More documentation and example notebooks
